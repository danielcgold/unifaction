<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<p>Greetings! Welcome to UniFaction's Terms of Service. You're in for a treat today – our TOS is refreshingly simple. We believe that the terms of service should be easy to understand and helpful to our users rather than being wrapped in intentionally vague statements that are designed to confuse the reader. Unfortunately, vague  legal jargon is a reality of what happens in societies that haven't managed to handle business maturely. In our present state of affairs, vague legal jargon is sometimes the best defense for protecting those who are just trying to make something awesome for others. Ideally, we as a species could do more productive things than waste our time with such legal nonsense, but you can’t really argue with stupidity when stupidity is in charge.</p>

<p>This bring up an important and unfortunate fact: even though 99.99% of you don't need a TOS to behave maturely, there is a tiny minority of people who use any legal exploit they can imagine to troll and berate others, or who otherwise need a strict set of guidelines to function in society. That's why the typical TOS you see today is packed with things that are designed to strip said people of all their potential rights on a site – you can thank everyone who lacks general maturity for that. Generally speaking, most companies don't actually want to strip you of your rights; they want to protect themselves from every conceivable situation that should really just be marked down as common sense.</p>

<p>Here's a good example of this: let's say that someone posts something on this site. If we don't specifically indicate that we now own the rights to that content, the original poster could claim that because we weren't given the rights to it that we now have to bend over backwards and spend all of our time and resources to resolve whatever changes they desire regarding that content. Not only can we not afford to do that, it doesn't make sense to enable it. However, since there are people who seek to exploit that, everyone else is unfairly penalized for it.</p>

<p>I know what you're thinking: wouldn't the legal system just have common sense in a matter like that? HAHAHAHAHAH. I'm just kidding. No one thinks that.</p>

<p>So here's the deal. I would MUCH rather deal with you in a responsible, mature manner. And in all of the instances where it is possible to deal with people as such, we will seek to do so to the best of our ability. But at the same time, I am unwilling to take so bold a step as to relinquish the need for a TOS and not protect ourselves from the crazy out there. So I will be protecting myself in the same way that other sites do.</p>

<p>But before we go much further, here’s a quick summary of what UniFaction cares about: we want to make the world a better place, we want to make our users happy, and we want to make a profit so that we can continue those objectives. As long as you’re not interfering with any of those goals, you’re a friend of ours. And common sense would dictate that friends work well together. So if your brain happens to be capable of common sense - there you go. That's how we'd like to work with you.</p>

<p>To make things easier for everyone, we’ve also decided that this TOS will work across ALL of the official UniFaction sites. In rare cases there may be a few adjustments needed for individual sites, but we will try very hard to limit that as much as humanly possible – ideally we won't have to do that anywhere. This TOS will serve as the official TOS for the majority of UniFaction sites, and be the ONLY source you will need to know in order to understand the terms of using it.</p>

<p>The same is true of our Privacy Policy, which is a document that we HIGHLY recommend that you read. Not only will it explain the privacy of our site, but it is helpful at understanding privacy in general.</p>

<p>To protect our site, we may need to update and apply a long list of legal rules in this document. Many of those rules may be written with complicated terminology by lawyers who understand it to avoid any legal exploitation, but we will do whatever we can help you understand them in more simple terms. Nevertheless, we do have to use terminology that will product us in all of the appropriate situations, so hopefully our summaries will suffice in making this a more enjoyable document to review.</p>

<p>UniFaction requires the ability to store, modify, and show data that is created on the site. Otherwise the site can't function. If we can't show or store data that gets created on the site, the site wouldn't do anything. While this would seem rather obvious, we have to explicitly state that we require this ability. This document requires that all users grant us the right to store, modify, and reveal to others, any information that is created or acquired from the users browsing this site. This includes any data you submitted through our forms, gathered from the use of our links, or while otherwise browsing our site. For example, if you submit an image or comment on one of our sites, we have the right to save that post in our database and show it to others when people view that post. We also have the right for admins and moderators to edit the post if it is necessary to do so.</p>

<p>It's important to understand why UniFaction reserves the rights to your content once it is put on our site. Users often don't understand the consequences of certain types of content removal. To a user, it may seem that removal of certain forms of content is as simple as “Well, just delete it...” - that's not the issue. The issue is all of the OTHER content that links to that content. What happens to it? It becomes a massive blob of web-goo that disappears into the void of our systems, causing dead links and missing connections.</p>

<p>Here's a metaphor of what we mean by that. Let's say that someone works at a job for three years. Certainly there are things that the employer did at the job that could be removed without consequence – his office could be cleared out, his name can be removed from the registry, etc. But throughout the course of his job he spends his time working on several training manuals, builds the infrastructure of their tech department, and is responsible for almost half of the procedures that the company uses to do business. On the day that he leaves, he says “Oh, and, now you can't use the things that I created for you.” - Okay, so the ramifications of that would be obvious. Suddenly the company would have vast holes in their system, causing untold problems for the remainder of people that work there. Not to mention it would cost the company a ridiculous amount time and money to actually go about the process of seeking out every detail that was related to his work and removing it.</p>

<p>Everyone can relate to how absurd this example would be, and common sense would dictate “Oh, well, we wouldn't request that. THAT would be ridiculous.” But not everyone is familiar with how the web works and how systems can interrelate just as intensely – particularly this system. Some may just see content as something we can just snap our fingers and make magically go away without any consequence. That is not the case. There are certain forms of content on the system that would cause severe complications to remove.</p>

<p>Because of this (and for other legal reasons), UniFaction MUST reserve the right to the content that is created on the site. If we were to allow anyone to retroactively request removal of content that they created on the site, it would be impractical on many levels. We just simply can't allow it. However, we DON'T want you to be in a situation where that ever happens. You should never feel like you are helpless in the content that exists on our site because that is not our intention at all. It would make us uncomfortable knowing that you were unhappy with said content, and we would like to avoid that. We've taken a few precautions in this matter. For starters, much of our site has content that is like the office furniture in the metaphor – you can remove it at will. A lot of content is “non-consequential” in the sense of removal, and is made easy to remove. For the content that isn't so easily removed (and of which doesn't have the option for removal), we ask that you always make sure for YOUR sake that you are comfortable with the content that you want to provide. That way, we're all happier in the end.</p>

<p>The system is without warranty, which means we don't take any legal responsibility for any errors, bugs, or other issues occur while using our site. Obviously it is in our best interest to eliminate those complications and make sure everything is working perfectly, but any shortcomings of perfections will be taken as they are.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to defend ourselves with the full extent of the law. If you're using this site, we expect you to acknowledge this. Any limitations of the law to defend ourselves will only apply in the areas in which those limitations exist.</p>

<p>UniFaction, at least for now, reserves the right to update this TOS at any time. I know, I know, it's not the ideal practice. I get it. I'll try to eliminate this rule once I feel secure in our legal protection. But I'm not a lawyer. I'm just here to create projects for you. If I could do without this TOS, I would. In the meantime, if there's something I'm missing here that needs to be added to make sure we're safe from conflicts, I'm going to add it. Once we have something firmly established that covers everything we need to, I'll make sure that the TOS is only updated after giving proper notice to everyone.</p>

<p>As a final note, you're a human being with a vote and a voice. The legal system is garbage and everyone knows it. Fixing it is going to require common sense. If there comes a time when you can use your voice to help resolve these issues, please do.</p>
